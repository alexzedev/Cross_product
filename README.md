The cross product, also known as the vector product, is a fundamental operation in vector algebra that produces a new vector perpendicular to the plane containing the original two vectors. Unlike the dot product, which yields a scalar quantity, the cross product results in a vector. This operation is extensively used in physics, engineering, computer graphics, and other fields to describe various phenomena involving vectors, such as torque, angular momentum, magnetic fields, and three-dimensional rotations.
